# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

This is a Password Generator code using HTML CSS and Javascrpit

I build this website beacuse we have been asked to complete the starter code that we given from bootcamp as Assignment project

So, this Assignment project solves Password Generator code using Javascrpit.

After clicking the generate button the website prompt the user for the password length.

The user is supposed to enter a length of password .

The minimum characters are 8 and the maximum characters are 128.

And Then the user is asked if he/she wants to include lowercase, upper case, numbers and specail characters.

And the  the user should select at least one character type

Finally  the generate password based will be displayed to the user based on the selected criteria

.

.

I have learnt a lot like how to Javascrpit functions, variables, for loop , if conditions etc.
